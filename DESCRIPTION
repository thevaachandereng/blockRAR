Authors@R: c(person(given = "Thevaa",
             family = "Chandereng",

Description: Computes power for blocked response-adaptive randomization. The randomization ratio 
    is altered based on group results rather than per patients. This allows for the analysis of 
    time trend together with treatment trend.
